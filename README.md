## Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of Steamy Mug’s coffee shop’s operational and sales performance, with the primary objective of uncovering insights that can inform strategic decision-making. The analysis leverages transactional and product-level data collected from the shop’s operations to assess revenue performance, customer purchasing behaviour, top-selling product categories, and branch-level efficiency.

The business environment for retail coffee outlets has grown increasingly competitive, requiring a data-backed approach to drive profitability, optimize inventory, and enhance customer satisfaction. Through this report, we aim to uncover patterns in sales trends, product demand, and transactional frequency that will help identify areas of strength and opportunities for growth.
The dataset used includes daily sales records with variables such as quantity sold, unit price, revenue, product category, transaction ID, and location. By systematically analysing this data, the report seeks to recommend actionable strategies that can support both short-term operational improvements and long-term business sustainability.

## Executive Summary 

This analysis explores key performance indicators and transaction-level data from a coffee shop to evaluate its business health and highlight strategic opportunities. The assessment revealed a total of 14,117 units sold across 9,971 transactions, generating approximately $46,374.25 in revenue and a profit margin of $16,230.99. These figures reflect moderate transactional volume with room for improvement in both pricing efficiency and customer upselling strategies.

Snacks, Sandwiches, and Desserts emerged as the top-selling product categories by volume, indicating a high demand for quick-consumption, convenience-based items. Sales trends showed noticeable fluctuations, with January reporting the highest revenue in Q1, followed by a dip in February and a partial rebound in March.

•	Sandwiches: 2,068 units

•	Desserts: 2,050 units

These categories show consistently strong demand and should be prioritized in inventory planning and promotional efforts.

Sales Trend Observation (Q1):

•	January recorded the highest revenue: $1,695.79

•	February experienced a decline: $1,105.39

•	March showed partial recovery: $1,429.73

## Analysis (Facts, Insights, Recommendation, Outcome)

**1. Product Category Performance**

Fact:

- Top Categories by Quantity Sold:

o	Snacks (2,082 units)

o	Sandwiches (2,068 units)

o	Desserts (2,050 units)

- Top Categories by Revenue:
  
o	Desserts ($7,204.40)

o	Sandwiches ($6,756.61)

o	Tea Beverages ($6,674.11)

Insight:

There is a clear overlap between the top product categories by volume and revenue — notably Sandwiches and Desserts, which rank high in both lists. However, Snacks, while leading in volume, do not appear among the top revenue categories, suggesting they have a lower unit price. Conversely, Tea and Coffee Beverages show strong revenue performance despite not leading in quantity, indicating higher pricing per unit.

This reveals a pricing-versus-volume dynamic: high-selling items like snacks may drive traffic, while premium items like tea and coffee lift revenue.

Recommendation:

Maintain a balance between volume drivers (like Snacks) and margin boosters (like Tea Beverages and Desserts). Explore bundling high-volume items with higher-margin items to raise the average ticket size. Also consider highlighting high-margin products more prominently in-store and on menus.

Outcome:

Optimized product mix strategy, increased revenue per transaction, and improved margin contribution across product lines.

**2. Revenue and Profitability**

Fact: The coffee shop generated a total revenue of $46,374.25, with a profit margin of ₦16,230.99, across 9,971 transactions.

Insight: While transaction volume is high, the average revenue per transaction remains modest, suggesting an opportunity to boost spend per visit.

Recommendation: Introduce upselling at the point of sale, loyalty programs, or combo discounts to encourage larger purchases per transaction.

Outcome: Increased average transaction value, better profit margins, and higher customer retention.


**3. Sales Trend Analysis**

Fact:

Revenue across the two years followed a consistent monthly pattern:

•	2021: Sales peaked in January (₦1,695.79), dropped sharply in February (₦1,105.39), then recovered moderately between March and December, averaging roughly $1,200 – $1,300 monthly.

•	2022: The trend repeated, with a strong start in January ($1,660.00) and similar mid-year stabilization. The February dip (₦1,255.85) was less severe, and March (₦1,258.79) maintained the rebound pattern.

Insight:

There’s a noticeable seasonal pattern where January consistently delivers the highest revenue, likely influenced by holiday momentum or New Year traffic. A February slump occurs each year, followed by steady stabilization. This cyclical trend suggests predictable peaks and troughs in consumer spending.

Recommendation:

Prepare for Q1 fluctuations by boosting marketing efforts in February with promotions or limited time offers. Maximize January traffic with upselling strategies and pre-holiday campaigns. Use historical patterns to forecast inventory and staffing needs.

Outcome:

More resilient monthly revenue, better demand forecasting, and higher sales retention during low-performing periods.

4. Branch Performance
   
Fact: Revenue by branch reveals the following:

•	Central Park: $10,929.97

•	Madison Street: $5,799.48

•	Capitol Hill: $5,526.11

Central Park leads significantly, generating nearly double the revenue of the next branch.

Insight: The Central Park branch is the top-performing location, likely benefiting from high customer traffic, strong location appeal, or superior service. The performance gap between Central Park and the others suggests disparities in local demand or operational execution.

Recommendation: Investigate operational strategies, staff practices, or customer engagement efforts at Central Park for potential replication at Madison Street and Capitol Hill. Explore targeted promotions or local partnerships to boost visibility and sales at the underperforming branches.

Outcome: Elevated performance across all locations, enhanced brand consistency, and maximized revenue potential across the network.

**5. City-Based Sales Performance**

Fact:

The top cities by quantity of items sold are:

•	Los Angeles: 3,358 units

•	Chicago: 3,332 units

•	New York: 3,202 units

These three cities collectively account for the majority of total sales volume.

Insight:

Sales volume is evenly distributed across these key urban areas, with only marginal differences between them. This suggests relatively consistent demand across branches located in high-density or high-footfall zones. The data indicates strong market penetration and brand presence in each city.

Recommendation:

Ensure inventory levels and product availability remain consistent across all high-performing cities. Consider city-specific promotions to further drive loyalty or reward frequent customers. Additionally, evaluate operational efficiencies in these cities to see if the consistent demand is matched by optimal staffing and service delivery.

Outcome:

Higher customer satisfaction through improved availability, targeted marketing by location, and more efficient resource planning across the network.

## Any Other Insights

Beyond the structured categories analysed, several additional patterns and strategic observations emerged from the dataset:

**1. Product Diversity Supports Broad Appeal**

The close range in sales volumes across multiple product categories — such as Snacks, Sandwiches, Desserts, and Beverages — indicates a well-balanced product mix. This suggests that the coffee shop successfully caters to a range of customer preferences, from quick snacks to specialty drinks. This diversity can be leveraged for upselling by promoting complementary products.

**2. Opportunity to Improve Low-Revenue Transactions**

With nearly 10,000 transactions processed but only ₦46,374.25 in total revenue, the average revenue per transaction is under $5. This points to either small basket sizes or low-priced items dominating sales. There’s a clear opportunity to increase transaction value through curated bundles, value-added offerings, or loyalty-driven incentives.

**3. Profitability Concentrated in Select Product Lines**

Tea Beverages and Desserts perform strongly in terms of revenue but don’t lead in quantity sold, confirming that they are premium-priced categories. This reinforces the importance of not just focusing on volume but understanding which categories carry higher profit contribution per unit.

**4. Seasonal Trends Are Consistent Year-over-Year**

The similarity in revenue dips and recoveries across Q1 in both 2021 and 2022 supports the case for predictive seasonality. With this foresight, the business can proactively align marketing, stock management, and staffing to match expected demand swings.

**5. Central Park Branch as a Model Store**

The Central Park branch significantly outperforms others, generating over $10,000 in revenue — almost double what the next branch achieves. This location could serve as a blueprint for operational excellence, customer engagement, or product placement strategies in other outlets.

## Conclusion

This analytical review of the coffee shop's operational data reveals a business that has built a solid foundation across product diversity, customer reach, and location presence. The shop recorded over 14,000 units sold across nearly 10,000 transactions, generating a revenue of $46,374.25 with a profit margin exceeding ₦16,000. These figures confirm a healthy level of engagement and transactional activity.

Key findings highlight that Snacks and Sandwiches drive volume, while Desserts and Tea Beverages deliver stronger revenue per unit, underscoring the need for a product strategy that balances affordability with margin optimization. The branch-level analysis identifies Central Park as a performance leader, suggesting an opportunity to replicate its model across less active locations like Madison Street and Capitol Hill.

A clear seasonal sales trend was observed in both years analyzed — with January consistently peaking, followed by a February dip and a recovery through subsequent months. This recurring pattern provides a valuable opportunity to optimize inventory, promotions, and staffing in anticipation of predictable demand cycles.

Additionally, city-level data revealed evenly distributed sales volumes among Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, suggesting uniform brand strength across locations. However, the relatively low average revenue per transaction presents a critical growth opportunity, best addressed through upselling, bundle offers, and targeted promotions.

Moving forward, the coffee shop is well-positioned to scale its profitability and operational impact by leveraging data-driven decisions. By focusing on high-margin product visibility, enhancing transaction value, replicating high-performing models across locations, and planning proactively around seasonal trends, the business can unlock meaningful growth while maintaining its appeal to a diverse and loyal customer base.
